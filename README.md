# Game_Simulations

Consider a 3-person game that is played 100 times per day. This game involves various random factors that are outside the control of the players of the game, so it is not guaranteed that the best-performing player will win each game. Suppose furthermore that, based on tens of thousands of games of historical data, a player can estimate his or her probability of winning a particular game independently of all other games (**p_win_game**) as the proportion of historical games that he or she won. In this project I wanted to explore 2 questions:

1. **In a typical day, what is the distribution of how many games a player can expect to win?**
2. **In a typical day, how many losing streaks of various sizes should a player expect?**

## In a typical day, what is the distribution of how many games a player can expect to win?

This question is explored in [Simulating_Daily_Win_Totals.ipynb](https://github.com/nateofspades/Game_Simulations/blob/master/Simulating_Daily_Win_Totals.ipynb)


Lastly, suppose that in order for a day of 100 games to be considered successful overall, the minimum proportion of games that must be won (**min_prop_games_won**)
